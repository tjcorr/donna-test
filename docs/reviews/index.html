  <p>We had a great time in Florida- Disney and Universal Studios were a blast.  We were able to see quite a bit at all of the parks.  The weather was great except the first Wednesday, when it rained while we were at Animal Kingdom.  We went to Cocoa Beach for our day off, and the kids had a good time there seeing the ocean for the first time. We want to thank you for all of the help that you provided us related to the trip.  Thank you very much for your help!!
<cite>Jason</cite></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Donna did a phenomenal job for us during every step of the process.  She counseled us from the early planning stages all the way through to our post-cruise plans.  She listened to us and made great recommendations to us based our wishes and concerns.  It was so helpful to have Donna checking up on us in the weeks leading up to our cruise.  With our busy lives, it was difficult to think about all the details, but Donna took care of everything.  Having her available by phone and email was perfect for us; her expert “boots-on-the-ground” knowledge of the cruise and the parks saved the day for us more than once.  I would highly recommend Donna and Pixie Vacations.  Having an expert assist you in planning your trip and supporting you all the way is priceless!
<cite>Hutto Family</cite></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Donna, Donna, Donna…. this quickly became a household name for us whenever we discussed Disney. Even my husband became excited about the trip and would say, “Ask Donna about —-“. I would ask her and it would happen! From the moment she gave us a no-pressure hassle-free quote, to the second we booked, to the planning leading up to our trip, to our time in Disney- Donna became part of our vacation. She made sure that we did just the right things for our family and at our own pace. I am very grateful that she was incredibly compassionate towards some special health needs we had on our trip, as well as traveling with a toddler. Her confidence, inviting demeanor, knowledge of Disney, and approachability made our trip worry-free. She even sent us gifts ahead of time, covered the fare for a van to ensure we made a dining reservation, and had gifts waiting at our hotel! We have been back for one week and I have already recommended her and Pixie Vacations to many people. Thank you for a magical vacation!

  <p>Donna helped us book our resort reservations and all of our sit-down dining reservations. Once I told her which restaurants we were interested in, she sent me a spread sheet of available times for those meals. She sent us spreadsheets with park hours and parade and firework times for our travel dates. She helped us book our flights. She sent us an amazing 10 page summary with day by day suggestions and hints, including exactly how to navigate the Orlando airport and Magical Express Service and how to best navigate each park. Most importantly, she helped us make some very last minute decisions on travel and flights as our trip was impacted by Hurricane Sandy. At her suggestion, we ended up flying out of Philadelphia a day early to beat the impending storm. Had we not left on 10/28/12 we would have been stuck in Philly until mid-week and would have missed half of our trip. On the Friday night before our trip, she helped us late into the evening and early the next morning make alternate travel arrangements and book an additional night at another resort (All Star Music). She then arranged and payed OUT OF POCKET for a private car to come pick up us up at the 1st hotel and transport us to the Polynesian to begin the rest of our previously planned vacation. I cannot say enough positive things about Donna and our experiences with using Pixie. I had no intentions of booking this trip through a travel agent, and had, in fact, been dragging my feet about booking a trip to Disney at all. Meeting her at local neighborhood day was the best thing that could have happened to us. She was extremely knowledgeable and helpful and made planning a very overwhelming vacation simple.
<cite>Morraye Family</cite></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I was so impressed with Donna’s knowledge and expertise of Disney World! From booking a resort that fit our budget, to knowing the ins and outs of traveling with small children, Donna was amazing. Her guidance in choosing the best restaurants, including character dining, provided us with delicious food and incredible experiences for our family! We absolutely loved Akershus! We were able to get the most out of our time at each park and even relax! Whether you’re a repeat Disney visitor or a first-timer, I’m sure Donna will be able to make your vacation magical! We can’t wait to book with her again!
<cite>Jahoda Family</cite></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My husband and I decided it was time to plan a Disney trip for the kids. I had only been to Disney once when I was 4 years old and planning felt very overwhelming. Everyone I spoke to have different advice and different suggestions. Luckily I found Donna! Her enthusiasm and attention to detail were impeccable. She took her time to understand our families age range, interests and even food preferences. Any unplanned issue that arose Donna was there to solve it. She was honestly there from start to finish.  While in Disney my daughter got ill and Donna gave me step by step instructions to get the necessary medical attention. We will definitely be using Donna again and I can’t recommend her enough!
<cite>Willauer Family</cite></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Donna is top notch! I give her a price or a location and she runs with it. Always helpful in making a smart vacation choice. She is always warm and welcoming when you ask questions, even ones that you might think you should already know. She is always quick to respond and also give you helpful tips. She even checks in with you on the trip to make sure things are going smooth! I would never book with anyone other than her.
<cite>Jenna S.</cite></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Donna did an outstanding job helping us with our Disney trip. She’s so knowledgeable about all things Disney, so everything she planned for us was perfect. She recommended the best places to eat, and she expertly helped us book our fast passes. Donna even did our itinerary planning so we would know where to go and when so that we made the best use of our limited time in Orlando.
<cite>Corrigan Family</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Donna is awesome! She goes the extra mile and always with a big smile. Grateful for your professionalism and heart.
<cite>Sabrina P.</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Donna was super patient and super helpful. I must have changed my mind 20 times with our honeymoon and she didn’t bat an eye. She offered options when I asked and didn’t push a thing. I highly recommend her if you need a travel agent.
<cite>Balasco Family</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Donna was great. She worked hard to ensure we had the greatest value for our trip. She was able to get a better rate than anywhere we saw online! She was always responsive, quick to answer questions, and patient when explaining various aspects of the booking experience (for example travel insurance). I feel like she really went above and beyond, the extra mile. I can’t wait to book our next trip!
<cite>Josh H.</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Donna helped us organize and plan every day of our Disney World trip, which was critical since we had our 2 and 4 year old plus grandparents. She made recommendations based on OUR interests and really helped design the most ideal week ever. With so much going on at one park, it was helpful she was able to get us to all the places we all wanted to go (even knew the importance of pointing out restrooms and good places to find some quiet time with the kids!)
<cite>Sprayberry Family</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Donna’s knowledge of all things Disney, cruise lines, and other theme parks and destinations is unmatched! She is super communicative and available, and always trustworthy.
<cite>Fleming Family</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Donna is so wonderful to work with! She is very detail and attention oriented, she looks at all possibilities and prices and advises accordingly. She responds quickly and efficiently to any questions we have had, and makes the vacation stress-free and enjoyable. Donna goes above and beyond to make any vacation the experience of our lives.
<cite>Sarno Family</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>We have worked with Donna 3 times now. She is always patient and kind. She never makes you feel like you’re asking too many questions. And the best part? She’s just as excited for your vacation as you are.
<cite>Meyer Family</cite></p>
