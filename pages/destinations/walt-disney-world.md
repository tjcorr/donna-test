My love for Disney Vacations began when I was a child and was lucky enough to travel to the Walt Disney World Resort every year on our family vacations. As I got older, I just could not get enough to the point that I would have to have my next vacation planned before leaving Magic Kingdom for the last time so I could say “see you real soon” and mean it!  Through the course of my many vacations to Walt Disney World, eight trips (and counting) to Disneyland, multiple Disney Cruise Line Vacations, two Adventures by Disney guided vacations (another fantastic travel service that Disney offers with families in mind) and even one amazing trip to Disneyland Paris, I have had the opportunity to experience many aspects of Disney vacations and I would love to share that experience and knowledge with you.

My husband and I moved to Florida in the summer of 2013.  We now live less than three miles from the Magic Kingdom and are living our dream with our son here in the Sunshine State.  What that means for you is that I have very real and valuable knowledge and tips to share with you since we’re at the parks multiple times each week.  I know these vacations inside and out because I am so very lucky to live them!

While staying on property at Walt Disney World, I have stayed at every single on-property hotel. I have stayed at the Value resorts, the Moderate resorts, the Deluxe resorts, and even the Deluxe Villas, and can speak from personal experience about each one.. As someone who loves good food, I would be happy to share my thoughts about the counter service and table service restaurants inside the parks and resort hotels. Together, we will find the best meals (at the best value) for your family. My current checklist is down to about ten total restaurants I have not yet had the chance to experience on Disney property, and that list is getting smaller all of the time.

If you are interested in any of the special events like the Flower and Garden Festival, the Food and Wine Festival, or the International Festival of the Arts, I will gladly share my notes on the food booth offerings as well as entertainment to see or skip.  I’m an Epcot lover and foodie at heart!

As your travel agent, I will do everything in my power to provide you with the best vacation experience possible, because I will cater to your specific wants and desires. No two families are the same, and no two Disney vacations should be, either. I promise to work hard for you, and to provide the best vacation possible.
