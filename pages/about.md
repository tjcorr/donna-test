      My name is Donna DeGiacomo and I have been a travel advisor and concierge planner since February of 2012.  I was born and raised in a Philadelphia suburb where I lived the first 27 years of my life. After getting married and living a few years in the cold, my husband and I quickly realized we were spending all of our "fun" money traveling South to visit the theme parks, enjoy the gorgeous weather, and jump on cruises to the Caribbean, so we moved to central Florida that summer. Fast forward 10+ years and here we are with our son living in the vacation capital of the world! We are very lucky, and I am in the unique position of seeing the Disney World, Universal Orlando, and SeaWorld Orlando theme parks on a very regular (weekly!) basis to be able to share my knowledge and new happenings with clients.  In addition to being a theme park enthusiast, I am an avid cruiser, and have personally sailed with more than six different cruise lines having accrued over 200 nights at sea.  I believe that cruises can be perfect for everything from single travelers to honeymooners to multi-generational family units. I have been fortunate enough to experience a gamut of accommodations from an interior stateroom all the way up to a 6,600 sq. ft. three-bedroom Garden Villa.  I can help you select a cruise line, itinerary, and stateroom category that makes the most sense for your family, and have experience with group bookings to destinations including everyoneâ€™s bucket list destination: Alaska CruiseTours.  If laying on the beach and sipping on a cocktail or grabbing your scuba gear and diving is more your speed, I have ample experience with All-Inclusive resorts in the Bahamas and Caribbean and would love to help you reconnect with those who matter most in some of the most beautiful places on Earth.
